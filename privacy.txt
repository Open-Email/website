Privacy Policy
==============

Having a privacy policy has become a standard requirement—because too often,
our data is collected, manipulated, and sold without our consent or knowledge.
And usually, our only choice is to not use the tool we need.

We believe that can change.

Our short version: we can't, we don't, and we won't, but that's not considered
a valid legal policy today. So here’s the full story.

No Tracking. No Data Collection. No Analytics. No AI.
-----------------------------------------------------

OpenEmail apps do not collect, process, or share any personal information,
except for the data users explicitly choose to include in their public profile.

 - No tracking, no analytics, no behavioral data collection.  
 - No permanent message storage, messages are end-to-end encrypted and only
   accessible to intended recipients for a limited time.  
 - No AI-based content filtering, scanning, or monetization.

We Don't Use Cookies
--------------------

OpenEmail native apps do not use cookies. If you use the web version, we may
use essential cookies strictly for login sessions. No tracking or analytics
cookies are ever used.

Public Profiles Are Optional and User-Controlled
------------------------------------------------

Users may choose to create a public profile, which is uploaded to their mail
agent for others to access.

 - Users decide exactly what to include.  
 - No one is forced to create a profile—privacy is the default.  
 - OpenEmail developers do not store any profile data.  

No Third-Party Services or Ads
------------------------------

OpenEmail apps do not integrate with:

 - Third-party analytics or tracking services  
 - Advertising networks  
 - Data-sharing services  

No Centralized Servers. No Backdoors.
-------------------------------------

 - OpenEmail runs on a decentralized, open protocol. There are no central
   servers storing all user data.  
 - All messages are end-to-end encrypted, even we cannot access them. That 
   includes the metadata, such as the information on the parties with which 
   you are communicating with.
 - There are no backdoors, hidden data collection, or silent dependencies. 
   We cannot intercept message content even if forced to.

You Are in Full Control
-----------------------

 - You can delete your profile or messages at any time.  
 - No external accounts required—you control your identity and data.  
 - You decide who to communicate with, and what to share.  

Changes to This Policy
----------------------

If this policy changes, we’ll let you know via app updates or release notes.
Our commitment to privacy will never change.
