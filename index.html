        <h1>There's still time to make the internet what it was meant to be.</h1>      
        </div>
        <p>
          A place to create, share, and dream together - that vision still lives. 
          But today, it's often overshadowed by a handful of powerful corporations. 
          Once open and full of possibility, our online spaces have become tightly controlled. 
          Participation now comes at the cost of privacy: our data is harvested, our choices influenced, our conversations observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowhere is this more evident than in email, one of our most essential tools for communication. 
          Yet it hasn't evolved to better serve us. 
          Instead, a few companies control most of the world's email traffic. 
          Their platforms don't just deliver messages; they scan, classify, and monetize them.
        </p>
        <h2>This concentration of control has stalled progress.</h2>
        <p>          
          Email hasn't plateaued because it's done growing. It's because true innovation is impossible in a closed system. 
          These gatekeepers have little reason to support openness or change. 
          But when communication belongs to everyone, creativity and progress can thrive.        
          There's a better path ahead, a future where our digital lives are truly our own, private, open, and built for people, not profit.
        </p>

  
        <p>
          The current system works exactly as it was designed, to preserve control.
          Big Tech's email monopoly isn't just profitable; it's self-reinforcing. 
          By controlling spam filters, routing, and deliverability, they decide what messages reach whom. 
          A new email service can be silenced by a single algorithmic tweak, no explanation, no appeal.
        </p>        
        <p>
          This isn't a free market. It's a closed system that resists competition and suppresses innovation. 
          What they call “security” is often just control, surveillance wrapped in a friendly interface. 
          They read our messages, track our behavior, and claim it's all for our protection.        
          But real security protects freedom, not power. And real innovation starts with openness.
        </p>

        <h1>OpenEmail: Privacy. Simplicity. Freedom.</h1>
        <p>                    
          A reinvention of asynchronous, long-form communication, with the familiarity of email, 
          but free from surveillance, free from gatekeepers, and built on a new, open, radically simple public protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenEmail is decentralized and secure by default. 
          It offers true end-to-end encryption and a privacy-first model that doesn't require trusting anyone with your data. 
          There are no gatekeepers, no hidden agendas, just an open system available to all.
        </p>

        <p>
          An inbox <b>without surveillance.</b> Where messages are private and <b>trustworthy by design.</b>
          No spam. No arbitrary limits. Send anything. Recall when needed.
          Stay connected without relying on social media.
          Rediscover the clarity and calm of <b>denoised communication.</b>
        </p>
                        
        <h2>Download OpenEmail. It's free.</h2>
        <h3>Soon even on your own domain.</h3>

        <p>
          We believe the internet should respect the individual, not exploit them.          
          That communication should be free and private, not monitored or monetized.
          That connection should feel human, not engineered for profit.
        </p>
  
        <h1>This is how we begin again, with the internet of tomorrow, in our hands today.</h1>
