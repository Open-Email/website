      <h1>The internet was a promise of human connection, a place where we could create, connect, and dream.</h1>
      <h3>Now, it has become something far different.</h3>

        <p>A handful of tech giants have colonized our digital world for their benefit. They don't just host our digital lives, they control them.</p> 
        <p>To them, we're data points, profiles to be bought and sold. They've locked us into their platforms, where the price of participation is our most intimate data.</p>

        <h2>Email, our essential communication tool, reveals the depth of this systemic failure.</h2>
        <p>Today, Google and Microsoft control most of the world's email traffic. Their algorithms read every message, not to help us, but to learn how to sell to us, shape our opinions, and predict what we'll do next.</p> 
        <h3>We pay by surrendering our privacy.</h3>
        <h2>The tech oligopoly has no incentive to change.</h2>
        <p>Their current model prints money, and they actively create barriers to block competition and suppress innovation.</p>
        <p>Their control over spam filters, routing, and deliverability allows them to decide what messages are sent and received. A new email service can be effectively silenced with a single algorithmic decision.</p>
        <h3>This isn't a free market.</h3>
        <p>It's a rigged system that preserves dominance by systematically crushing competitors.</p>
        <h2>They betray the internet's original promise.</h2>
        <p>Big Tech tells us they're creating a safer, more secure world. But what they call security is really control. They listen to our conversations, track our clicks, and build detailed maps of our lives, all while claiming to protect us.</p>
        <h3>This is not security.</h3> 
        <p>It's institutionalized surveillance, and it undermines our freedom.</p>

        <h2>OpenEmail is our response. Imagine an internet that works for you, not against you.</h2>
        <p>Email runs through the veins of the internet. By changing how we email, we might just change the internet itself.</p>
        <p>This isn't just another email service. It's a reinvention of email itself, liberated from surveillance and corporate gatekeepers, built on a new, <a href="https://github.com/Open-Email/MailHTTPS-Protocol">open and simple protocol.</a></p>
        <p>OpenEmail is a decentralized, secure email-like system that offers true end-to-end encryption and a sustainable, privacy-first model.</p>
        <p>It's a system that doesn't require trusting anyone with your data. It's open by design, without gatekeepers and barriers, available to all.</p>

        <h2>We believe in an internet that respects the individual.</h2>
        <p>We believe in free communication that puts users in control and values human connection over corporate profit.</p>
        <p><a href="#stores" class="button">Download OpenEmail <img src="/img/download.svg"/></a> â€” It's free, even on your own domain.</p>
        <p>Email without worrying who's listening, forget spam ever existed, send large files without limits, recall messages you didn't mean to send, stay connected without social media, and regain your creative focus.</p>
        <p>Let's reclaim direct communication with our friends, families, and teammates. Let's break free from censors, gatekeepers, surveillance, and the outdated systems that serve control, not connection.</p>
